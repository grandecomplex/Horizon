### Mobile View Management Framework

My goal is to create a very light-weight wrapper for creating mobile web apps. At this stage, I have a few more bugs to clean up, before I release the framework with a website and documentation.

Currently, it is powering Dolo - http://www.doloapp.com.

#### Why make this?
Because jQueryMobile, Sencha, etc are all so heavy-weight. They contain so much. They are great frameworks, but I want to choose exactly the styles I want without any extra weight. Thus, Horizon was born.
